## ❖・Introduction・❖
Create a *single* web page consisting of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that creates a carousel of images sourced from a local file system using JSONP, much like how a full-stack app might read data from a database. A 26-second video of what’s required for this project is available from [http://vanegas.cs.hartford.edu/uploads/videos/cs-275/working-with-jsonp.mp4](http://vanegas.cs.hartford.edu/uploads/videos/cs-275/working-with-jsonp.mp4).

You will need to implement from scratch development and production Gulp tracks for this project. Running `gulp serve` should invoke the development track; running `gulp build` should invoke the production track.

**Note**: _You may **only** work within the confines of the included scaffold._
